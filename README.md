# scq
Our main repo for the SCQ senior project.

## Installing Dependenices:
We are using virtual environments to manage our dependencies and make sure they are the same between dev environments. If you don't have a virtualenv setup for this project, this is how to do it.

To setup virtualenvs in general on your computer, do the following:
```
brew install nodejs
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

To setup our specific environment:
```
mkvirtualenv scq
```

Whenever you are going to work on the project to ensure that we are all using the same dependencies:
```
workon scq
```

Add the following to ~/.bashrc (or zshrc if you use one):

```
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/Envs
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

Then source it (bashrc example below):
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

Make sure to have installed ldap
```
sudo apt-get install -y python-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev
pip install python-ldap
```

Then go to the project and run this command in your project directory to install the dependencies.
```
make build
```
you will likely be asked for sudo privileges to install all needed packages
